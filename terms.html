        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Submitted Materials </h3><br>
        <p> Unless specifically requested, we do not solicit nor do we wish to receive any confidential, secret or proprietary information or other material from you through the Websites, by e-mail or in any other way. Any and all comments, information, creative works, demos, ideas, suggestions, concepts, methods, systems, designs, plans, techniques or other materials submitted or sent by you to us via any medium (including, for example and without limitation, photos, audio, video, messages, text, files or other content which you submit or post to our chat rooms, message boards, comment sections and/or our blogs, social media pages or feeds, or send to us via e-mail) (“Submitted Materials”) will be deemed not to be confidential or secret, and may be used by us in any manner consistent with these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy.

You are solely responsible for creating backup copies of your Submitted Materials if you desire. Under no circumstances will AEA be liable for any inaccuracy or defect in any Submitted Materials. </p><br><br>

        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Public Forums </h3><br>
        <p> AEA may, from time to time, make messaging services, chat services, bulletin boards, message boards, comment sections, blogs, other forums and other such services available on or through the Websites. In addition to any other rules or regulations that we may post in connection with a particular service, you agree that you shall not upload, post, transmit, distribute or otherwise publish through the Websites any Submitted Materials which <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Websites, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) are fraudulent, unlawful, threatening, abusive, harassing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, vulgar, offensive, pornographic, profane, sexually explicit or indecent, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) constitute or encourage conduct that would constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any local, state, national or international law, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) violate, plagiarize or infringe the rights of third parties including, without limitation, copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, contract, patent, rights of privacy or publicity or any other proprietary right, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v) contain a virus, spyware, or other harmful component, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vi) contain embedded links, advertising, chain letters or pyramid schemes of any kind, or <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vii) constitute or contain false or misleading indications of origin, endorsement or statements of fact. <br> You further agree not to impersonate any other person or entity, whether actual or fictitious, including anyone from AEA. You also may not offer to buy or sell any product or service on or through your Submitted Materials. You alone are responsible for the content and consequences of any of your activities. </p><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Right to Monitor; Editorial Control </h3><br>
        <p> AEA reserves the right, but does not have an obligation, to monitor and/or review all Submitted Materials and AEA is not responsible for any such Submitted Materials. However, AEA reserves the right at all times to disclose any Submitted Materials as necessary to satisfy any law, rule, regulation or government request, or to edit, refuse to post or to remove any Submitted Materials, in whole or in part, that AEA considers to be, in AEA’s sole discretion, objectionable or in violation of these Terms of Use, AEA’s policies or applicable law. If AEA elects to modify Submitted Materials, AEA nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the Submitted Materials. We may also impose limits on certain features of the forums or restrict your access to part or all of the forums without notice or penalty if we believe you are in breach of the guidelines set forth in this paragraph, our terms and conditions or applicable law, or for any other reason without notice or liability. </p><br><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Private or Sensitive Information on Forums </h3><br>
        <p> It is important to remember that comments submitted to a forum may be recorded and stored in multiple places, both on our Websites and elsewhere on the Internet, which are likely to be accessible for a long time and you have no control over who will read them now or in the future. It is therefore important that you are careful and selective about the personal information that you disclose about yourself and others, and in particular, you should not disclose sensitive, embarrassing, proprietary or confidential information in your comments to our public forums. </p><br><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Other Users </h3><br>
        <p> Each Website user is solely responsible for any and all of its Submitted Materials. Because we do not control Submitted Materials, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any Submitted Materials and we make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of any Submitted Materials, and we assume no responsibility for any Submitted Materials. Your interactions with other Website users are solely between you and such user. You agree that AEA will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as a result of such interactions. If there is a dispute between you and any Website user, we are under no obligation to become involved. You acknowledge that other users may post comments about your Submitted Materials which may be derogatory, and AEA has no obligation to monitor or delete any such Submitted Materials. You hereby release and forever discharge AEA (and our directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns) from, and herby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or relates directly or indirectly to, any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Website users. </p><br><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Linking to the Websites </h3><br>
        <p> You agree that if you include a link from any other websites to the Websites, such link shall link to the full version of an HTML formatted page of the Websites. You are not permitted to link directly to any image hosted on the Websites or our services, such as using an “in-line” linking method to cause the image hosted by us to be displayed on another website. You agree not to download or use images hosted on the Websites on another website, for any purpose, including, without limitation, posting such images on another site. You agree not to link from any other website to the Websites in any manner such that the Websites, or any page of the Websites, are “framed,” surrounded or obfuscated by any third party content, materials or branding. We reserve all of our rights under the law to insist that any link to the Websites be discontinued, and to revoke your right to link to the Websites from any other websites at any time upon written notice to you. </p><br><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Order For Products and Services </h3><br>
        <p> We may, directly or through our third-party vendors (“Vendors’), make certain products available to visitors and registrants of the Websites. You agree to pay in full the prices for any purchases you make either by credit/debit card concurrent with your online order or by other payment means acceptable to AEA or its Vendors. You agree to pay all applicable taxes. If payment is not received by us or such Vendors from your credit or debit card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us or the Vendors. Certain products that you purchase and/or download on or through the Websites may be subject to additional terms and conditions presented to you at the time of such purchase or download. We reserve the right to change the number of issues in a subscription term, including discontinuing any format, make substitutions and/or modify the manner in which the subscription is distributed. If your email or postal address changes, you agree to provide us with your updated address. </p><br><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Third Party Websites </h3><br>
        <p> You may be able to link from the Websites to third party websites and third party websites may link to the Websites (“Linked Sites”). You acknowledge and agree that we have no responsibility for the information, content, products, services, advertising, code or other materials which may or may not be provided by or through Linked Sites, even if they are owned or run by affiliates of ours. Links to Linked Sites do not constitute an endorsement or sponsorship by us of such Linked Sites or the information, content, products, services, advertising, code or other materials presented on or through such Linked Sites. The inclusion of any link to such Linked Sites on our Websites does not imply AEA’s endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of that site. AEA disclaims any liability for links <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) from another website to the Websites and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) to another website from the Websites. <br> AEA cannot guarantee the standards of any websites to which links are provided on the Websites nor shall AEA be held responsible for the contents of such sites, or any subsequent links. AEA does not represent or warrant that the contents of any third party websites are accurate, compliant with state or federal law, or compliant with copyright or other intellectual property laws. Also, AEA is not responsible for any form of transmission received from any Linked Sites. Any reliance on the contents of a third party website is done at your own risk and you assume all responsibilities and consequences resulting from such reliance. </p><br><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Advertisement and Promotions </h3><br>
        <p> AEA may run advertisements and promotions from third parties on the Websites. Your business dealings or correspondence with, or participation in promotions of, advertisers other than AEA, and any terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such third party. AEA is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of third-party advertisers on the Websites. </p><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Embedded Video Links </h3><br>
        <p> Certain pages of the Websites provide the functionality for you to “embed” videos appearing on the page on other web sites or blog pages (together with the Player, as defined herein, the “Embedded Video”). The functionality is provided by giving you the necessary HTML code to include on such page to make that Embedded Video appear. If you include the HTML on a web or blog page, the actual video stream for the Embedded Video will be served from our servers but the Embedded Video may be rendered to the visitor of that page as part of that page. If you elect to embed video on a page, you agree as follows: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) you will not alter, in any respect, the Embedded Video (including without limitation the content, format, and length and advertising associated therewith) from how it is served from our servers; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) you will not facilitate access to the Embedded Video directly or through any video player or other tool other than the video player that is provided by us when the Embedded Video appears (the “Player”); <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) without limiting the foregoing, you will not link directly to the Embedded Video file; and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) the Embedded Video may be used in part for commercial purposes, including on an advertising-supported page, provided that: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) the Embedded Video shall not be included in, or used as part of, a service that sells access to video content; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) you shall not insert advertising, sponsorship or promotional messages in, or immediately adjacent to, the Embedded Video or Player; and <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) to the extent you sell any advertising, sponsorship or promotional material to appear on the same page that includes the Embedded Video, the page includes other content not provided by us which is a sufficient basis for such sales. <br> You may not block, inhibit, build upon or disable any portion of the Player, including without limitation links back to our site. You understand and agree that all measured metrics related to the access and viewing of the Embedded Video shall be credited to the Websites. Without limitation of any provision of these Terms of Use, we shall have no liability to you for any reason with respect to your use of Embedded Video and you agree to indemnify, defend and hold us and our affiliates and our affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and agents harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising in any way from your use of the Embedded Video. </p><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Content Feed </h3><br>
        <p> RSS (really simple syndication) service and other syndication formats such as Atom, as well as APIs (application programming interfaces) (collectively, the “Content Feeds”) are means by which AEA offers feeds of story headlines in XML or JSON format (“AEA Content”) to visitors to the Website who use the applicable Feed aggregators. You must use the Content Feeds as provided by AEA, and you may not edit or modify the text, content or links supplied by AEA. The applicable Content Feed service may be used only with those platforms from which a functional link is made available that, when accessed, takes the viewer directly to the display of the full article on the Websites. You may not display the AEA Content in a manner that does not permit successful linking to, redirection to or delivery of the applicable Website web page. You may not insert any intermediate page, splash page or other content between the Content Feed link and the applicable Website web page. You must provide attribution to the appropriate Websites in connection with your use of the Content Feeds. If you provide this attribution using a graphic, you must use the appropriate Website logo that we have incorporated into the Content Feed. AEA reserves the right to discontinue providing any or all of the Content Feeds at any time and to require you to cease displaying, distributing or otherwise using any or all of the Content Feeds for any reason including, without limitation, your violation of any provision of these Terms of Use. AEA assumes no liability for any of your activities in connection with the Content Feeds or for your use of the Content Feeds in connection with your websites or any other properties. </p><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;"> Indemnification </h3><br>
        <p> You agree to indemnify, defend and hold AEA and its directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising in any way from <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) your use of the Websites, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) your placement or transmission of Submitted Materials or any other message, content, information, software or other materials through the Websites, and/or <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) your breach or violation of any applicable law or regulation or these Terms of Use. <br> AEA reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and in such case, you agree to cooperate with AEA’s defense of such claim. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of the General Counsel of AEA. </p><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;">  Copyright Agent </h3><br>
        <p> We respect the intellectual property rights of others, and require that the people who use the Websites, or the services or features made available on or through the Websites, do the same. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please forward the following information to AEA’s Copyright Agent, designated as such pursuant to the named below: </p>
        <p> Your address, telephone number, and email address; <br>
            A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed; <br>
            A description of where the alleged infringing material is located; <br>
            A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; <br>
            An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; and <br>
            A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf. </p><br>
