        <p> Other Individuals, Services, and Partners at Your Request: We will share your information with other individuals and services at your request. <br>
            For example, if you choose to interact with such co-branded products or services using your account information with us, we may share your account information with third parties as required to provide the co-branded product or service that you request. </p>
        <p> Third Party Partners to Provide Co-Branded Products and Services: Some of our Services may from time to time partner with a retailer or other third party to offer online shopping opportunities, services, subscriptions, registration opportunities for applications on a co-branded or cross-promotional basis (“Co-Branded Areas”). The information you provide in connection with the transaction may be collected directly by, or shared by AEA with, the third party, as well as with any participating sponsors or advertisers of such Co-Branded Areas. Some of our Services may offer you the ability to access a third-party site with whom we have a relationship to access both sites through a co-branded registration or password; in that event, your applicable registration information may be collected directly by, or shared by AEA with, the third-party partner. For example, if you choose to interact with such co-branded products or services using your account information with us, we may share your account information with third parties as required to provide the co-branded product or service that you request, including any information required for customer service. These third parties will use your information in accordance with their own privacy policy. </p>

These third parties include advertising networks, data exchanges, ad servers, certain analytics providers and others. The list of third party providers is found in the Section below entitled <a href="#linksofthirdpartysites"> “Third Party Cookies”. </a> This list may be updated from time to time. </p>

        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;" id="legalgrounds"> Legal Grounds For Processing Your Information </h3><br>
        <p><b> We collect information from you: </b></p>
        <p> Where we need it to perform our contract with you (i.e. our Terms of Service), <br>
            Where the processing is in our legitimate interests (provided that these aren’t overridden by your interests or rights) (such as personalizing our services and marketing for example), or <br>
            If we otherwise have your consent. <br>
            If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the <a href="#contactus"> “Contact Us” </a> section below. </p><br><br>
        <h3 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 30px;" id="onlineanalytics"> Online Analytics and Advertising </h3><br>
        <p> Delivery of Advertising and Other Content: In addition to ads and content that we serve you directly, AEA may use third party advertising companies and marketing services to serve ads and other content when you visit the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other applications you use. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, your searches, demographic data, user-generated content, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests. Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Services, other sites, and in other applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services. We sometimes provide our customer information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile applications. </p><br>
        <p> We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. </p><br>
        <p> If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out Page, the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. </p><br>
        <p> To learn more about how to manage your preferences regarding our cookie-based advertising, please see the <a href="#cookies"> “Cookie Management” </a> section in our Cookie Notice below. </p><br>
        <p> To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms. </p><br>
        <p> Please note that if you exercise the opt out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Services, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time. </p><br>
        <p> Mobile Advertising: When using mobile applications from AEA or others, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. We may use third-party service providers to deliver advertisements on mobile applications or for mobile application analytics. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving personalized in-application advertisements; thus, you should contact the platform provider for further details on opting out of tailored in-application advertisements. Often, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your mobile device or resetting the “Advertising Identifier” (like an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous “Advertising Identifier.” You may review the support materials and/or the device settings for the respective operating systems to opt-out of tailored in-app advertisements. </p>
        <p> Do Not Track. AEA does not act on “do not track” requests from your browser because, this way, we are able to personalize your experiences on our Services. </p><br><br>

        <p> Marketing Emails. If you want to stop receiving promotional e-mails from us, click on the “unsubscribe” link in any promotional email from us. Please note that once we receive your request, it may take an additional period of time for your opt-out to become effective. We may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with transaction information about the Services you are using, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service. </p>

You may opt-out of SMS messages from us by following the instructions provided in the message or by texting back STOP to the number we send the text from for that particular SMS message.
